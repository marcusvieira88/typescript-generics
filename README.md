### Introduction

This project has some examples of how to implement generics on Typescript.

Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later that are then instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters. This approach permits writing common functions or types that differ only in the set of types on which they operate when used, thus reducing duplication.

Following the Donâ€™t-Repeat-Yourself (DRY) principle is important when it comes to writing dynamic and reusable code. Using generics can help you achieve this in your TypeScript code.
With generics, you can write dynamic and reusable generic blocks of code. Furthermore, you can apply generics in TypeScript to classes, interfaces, and functions.
